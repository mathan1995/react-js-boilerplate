## Project Structure
- `/app` - Contains our React Native App codebase
  - `/api` - Api module class. Each file will be feature based like ProductAPI, LoginAPI etc
  - `/components` - universal shared components used by others.
  - `/config` - Universal styles,images,metrics etc..
  - `/lib` - lib helper files
  - `/navigation` - All naviagtion related studd including helpers functions and navigation stack
    - `NavigationHelpers.js` -  Use this class instead of depending on props.naviagtion
    - `NavigationService.js` - Service class for naviagtion
    - `NavigationStack.js` - Stack to define naviagtion. you can split things further if needed
  - `/redux` - Includes everything you need to set up store. 
    - `configureStore` - Combines all feature based sagas

## Prerequisites
* [Node](https://nodejs.org) v8.10 (it is recommended to install it via [NVM](https://github.com/creationix/nvm))
* [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
* A development machine set up for React Native by following [these instructions](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html)

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repo, `git clone https://github.com/mathan1995/react-js-boilerplate.git <your project name>`
2. Go to project's root directory, `cd <your project name>`
3. Remove `.git` folder,  `rm -rf .git`
4. Open `package.json` and change the `name` property with your project name
5. Open `index.js` and replace `'ReactNativeBoilerPlate'` by your project name
6. Open `app.json` and replace `'ReactNativeBoilerPlate'` by your project name 
7. Run `yarn` or `npm install` to install dependencies
8. Run `npm start`
9. Run `npm run test`
10. Start the packager with `npm start`
11. Connect a mobile device to your development machine

13. Enjoy!!!

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
